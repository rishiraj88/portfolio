# Some popular cloud offerings 

## OpenShift

**OpenShift** is a family of containerization software products developed by *Red Hat*. Its flagship product is the *OpenShift Container Platform* â€” an on-premises platform as a service built around Linux containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 

The family's other products provide this platform through different environments: 
- OKD serves as the community-driven upstream. 
- OpenShift Online is the platform offered as software as a service. 
- OpenShift Dedicated is the platform offered as a managed service.


## OpenStack
**OpenStack** is a free, open standard cloud computing platform. It is mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) in both public and private clouds where virtual servers and other resources are made available to users. 
The software platform consists of interrelated components that control diverse, multi-vendor hardware pools of:
- processing,
- storage, and
- networking resources 
throughout a data center. 

Users manage it either through:
- a web-based dashboard,
- through command-line tools, or
- through RESTful web services.

OpenStack began in 2010 as a joint project of *Rackspace Hosting* and *NASA*. As of 2012, it was managed by the *OpenStack Foundation*, a non-profit corporate entity established in September 2012 to promote OpenStack software and its community. By 2018, more than 500 companies had joined the project. In 2020, the foundation announced it would be renamed as the *Open Infrastructure Foundation* in 2021.

## Apache CloudStack
**CloudStack** is open-source cloud computing software for creating, managing, and deploying infrastructure cloud services. It uses existing hypervisor platforms for virtualization, such as:
- KVM,
- VMware vSphere, including ESXi and vCenter, and
- XenServer/XCP. 

In addition to its own API, CloudStack also supports the *Amazon Web Services (AWS) API* and *the Open Cloud Computing Interface* from *the Open Grid Forum*.

## Apache cloudstack
**CloudStack** is a [turnkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnkey) solution that includes the entire "stack" of features most organizations want with an IaaS cloud:
- compute orchestration,
- Network as a Service,
- user and account management,
- a full and open native API,
- resource accounting, and
- a first-class User Interface (UI).
