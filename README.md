- **FilesReadStringWriteString.java :** to read from and write to file
- **HttpClientPlus.java :** to demonstrate HttpClient for GET, POST and PUT request/response handling as in JDK 11
- **JavaRunClass.java :** to run the Java program with `java JavaRunClass.java` command form

## 2. LeetCode problems solved
- **LC01TwoSum.java :** Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
- **LC02AddTwoNumbers.java :** Given two non-empty linked lists representing twonon-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
- **LcMaxConsecutiveOnes.java :** to find the length of the longest subsequence having only 1's else to return 0
- **LcSeptemberLeetcodingChallenge2021Week4.java :** [WIP] to get the maximum length of possible words made with the segments provided in input arrays,  with the condition that no letters in the words must be repeated anyhow
